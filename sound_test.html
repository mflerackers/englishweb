            var pages = [`Many years before in old Japan 
there was an old man and his wife 
living in a small village next to a river 
The old man was called ojiisan 
The old woman was called obaasan 
Ojiisan cut wood for his job 
Obaasan washed clothes for her job 
They lived alone and had no children`,

`One day the old woman went to the river 
She had just begun washing the clothes when 
to her surprise a giant peach 
was floating down the river 
It was the biggest peach 
she had ever seen and she 
pulled it out of the water 
She took it home for supper`,

`When she got her knife to cut it open 
she heard the voice of a child say 
Wait don't cut me 
Suddenly the peach split open
and a beautiful baby boy jumped out 
The old people were very surprised 
More surprising the baby boy said 
Don't be afraid 
Heaven saw how lonely you were 
without any children and sent me to you`,

`So the old people happily took the baby
and raised him as their own son 
They named him Momotaro 
which means Peach Boy in Japanese 
They loved him very much and 
they raised him to be a very fine boy`];
